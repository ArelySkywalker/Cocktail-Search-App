## Info & ToDos

Version 1 is now live! There is still a lot of work to do on this baby. Some stuff I want to implement are 
 - 1. User Registration/Login
 - 2. User cocktail favorites
 - 3. User cocktail ratings

## How to run

Currently right now you can't run this app since I have it set up with my config files and Mongo DB. But once I finish this, I'll add dummy files so you can create your own DB and run yourself!

### Happy Hacking!
