Cocktail Search App that let's you search &amp; filter for cocktails built with React.<br>

## Info & ToDos

Version 1 is now live! There is still a lot of work to do on this baby. Some stuff I want to implement are 
 - 1. User Registration/Login
 - 2. User cocktail favorites
 - 3. User cocktail ratings

## Available Scripts

```
npm install
```
Installs packages needed to run this app. 

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>


### Happy Hacking!
